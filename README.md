# IODS-final project

# Abstract
We analyse financial data to predict future stock prices. Data includes typical stock metrics that are used when deciding upon investing on a stock. We find that if price of the stock has gone down during the previous year it is likely the price will gain in the future. Likewise, some sectors with high net profit margin tend to rise in price in the future.
