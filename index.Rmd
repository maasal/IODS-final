# Preliminaries

We analyse financial data from the SP500 index. We have data on historical prices and historical results of the companies (<http://data.okfn.org/data/core/s-and-p-500-companies>). We try to analyse which components predict future stock price. Update prices are fetched using quantmod package. The data wrangling file can be found at <>
